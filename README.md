Description: 
        This product focuses on the issue of college students struggling to find budget
        friendly and efficient recipes. The main stakeholders of this issue include the students, who are
        facing difficulty planning for meals, and their parents who are likely concerned about their
        health/meal planning while at school. Further, the university administration would be concerned
        about the well being of the students, including ensuring that students are eating adequate meals
        on campus. Our system will allow students to filter out the main ingredients they own, and use
        that information to recommend potential meals to make. The API we are using is as follows:
        https://www.themealdb.com/api.php. This API contains many recipes and it allows users to filter
        recipes by main ingredients. Our app will provide users with multiple recipe ideas with a main
        ingredient of their choice from the API. The front end technologies weâ€™ll be using to solve this
        challenge will be HTML and Javascript. Our system will help alleviate the pain college students
        go through researching meals to cook on the web, and determining what ingredients are required.
